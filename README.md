# learn-poker-charts

poker-chart-quizzes

The purpose of this program is to create, edit, and quiz yourself on poker charts. 

When learning to play poker, I found that nearly all of the programs I came across were behind some sort of pay-wall. After trying to memorize charts using hand-written notecards, I decided to make this program. 

There is 4 parts to the program: the chart creator, the chart viewer, pop quizzes, and chart reconstruction.
